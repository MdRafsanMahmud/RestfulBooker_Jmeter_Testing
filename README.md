# ðŸ§ª Restful Booker - JMeter Performance & Stress Testing

This project demonstrates performance and stress testing on the [Restful Booker API](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com) using **Apache JMeter**. It includes simulation of real-world traffic: login, create booking, and search booking, along with timed execution and report generation.

---

## âœ… What Has Been Done

* Designed a JMeter test plan (`booking.jmx`) that simulates:

  * User login
  * Booking creation with random data
  * Booking search using extracted booking ID
* Applied a **Gaussian Random Timer** (Deviation: 2000ms, Constant Delay: 500ms) for realistic traffic simulation
* Performed Load Testing in 3 steps:

  * Step 1: 5 minutes
  * Step 2: 10 minutes
  * Step 3: 20 minutes
* Performed Stress Testing by gradually increasing users until bottlenecks were observed
* Collected test results in `.jtl` format and generated:

  * ðŸ“Š HTML reports
  * ðŸ“ˆ Excel summary: `booking-api-test-report.xlsx`

---

## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

* JMeter 5.5 or later
* Java 8 or higher
* Git (for cloning the repo)

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Test

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/RestfulBooker_Jmeter_Testing.git
cd RestfulBooker_Jmeter_Testing

# Step 2: Open booking.jmx in JMeter

# Step 3: Run the test (GUI or CLI mode)
# For GUI: Open booking.jmx in JMeter and press Start
# For CLI:
jmeter -n -t booking.jmx -l booking.jtl

# Step 4: Generate HTML report
jmeter -g booking.jtl -o Reports/

# Optional: Replace old report
rm -rf Reports/ booking.jtl
```
